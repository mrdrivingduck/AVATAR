## I. Requirement

 - Java 1.8
 - [Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j)
 - GZoltar 0.1.1
 
## II. Run AVATAR

1. Clone the PatchParser:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SerVal-DTF/AVATAR.git`
    ```
  
2. Compile this project.
    ```bash
    ./compile.sh
    ```
  
3. Fix bugs with perfect fault localization, which means that the bug positions at line level are known and the fault localization technique is not needed. 
    ```bash
    ./LineFix.sh <BugID>
    ```

4. Fix bugs with restricted fault localization, which means that the bug positions at method level are known that will help increase the accuracy of fault localization.
    ```bash
    ./MethodFix.sh <BugID>
    ```
  
5. Fix bugs with normal fault localization, which means that AVATAR directly uses off-the-shelf fault localization techniques (such as GZoltar + Ochiai) to localize the faulty code positions.
    ```bash
    ./FLFix.sh <BugID>
    ```
